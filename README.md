# React + Vite

thia is a basic react project, a step counter or checker to learn to use the "useState" hook. 

it runs with "npm run dev". 

for style i use tailwind and css in order to mantain in clean on the basic code... love tailwind for easy and fast to style but i hate hot it get a messy code. To avoid the mess, i separate the 
large or complex style tailwind classes and use them into css documents. for some details i use pure css.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
